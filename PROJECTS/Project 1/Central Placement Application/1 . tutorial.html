                                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Technical interviews are common for employers recruiting for engineering, science, or software roles. Essentially it is an interview to assess your technical ability for the role, and the depth and breadth of your knowledge in your chosen field.<br>

                                Technical interviews are also designed to assess your problem-solving skills, your communication skills, and your ability to think under pressure. The process that is used to solve a given challenge is of interest to employers, as it gives them a glimpse into how you would solve a real-world problem at work.<br><br></p>

                            <h3>Formats For Technical Interviews</h3><br><br>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px;">There are various formats for a technical interview that you may encounter. Your experience will vary depending on:<br><br>

                              (1) The employer<br>
                              (2) The type of position (full time, co-op/internship)<br>
                              (3) The type of role (for example, software development, operations support, plant engineer, hardware design engineer)<br><br><br>
                              Some types of interview formats you should be prepared for (you may experience some or all of these formats during your interview process for a particular role):<br><br>
                              
                              <b>(1) Pre-interview online assessment:</b> Some employers use an online test of basic knowledge or a coding exercise to narrow down a field of candidates. This may happen before or after an initial phone screen. Generally, it is a timed test that must be completed by a given date.<br>
                              <b>(2) Phone Interview:</b> This may be a basic screen, with general background questions. There may also be a technical component of the interview. For coding positions, you may be asked to type answers into a shared Google Doc or collaborate on a shared editor like Coder Pad. Some companies may have multiple rounds of phone interviews. Make sure to clarify the format of the interview ahead of time.<br>
                              <b>(3) On-site Interview:</b> The technical component may involve answering questions related to knowledge about a particular topic, process, or product. You may be asked to outline the solution to a problem on a whiteboard or to make a presentation to a team. For coding interviews, be prepared to write code on a whiteboard, on a company-provided computer, or engage in a pair programmer assignment. There may be multiple rounds of onsite interviews with different teams. Make sure to clarify the format and ask with whom you will be interviewing with ahead of time.<br><br></p>

                                  <h3>What To Do During The Interview</h3><br><br>
                                  <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>(1) Think out loud and verbalize your thought process.</b> Remember that you are being evaluated on this!<br>
                                    <b>(2) Ask clarifying questions.</b> Make sure that you understand the problem and have all of the information that you need. Some problems may be vague or ill-defined to assess your confidence in asking questions and gathering data.<br>
                                    <b>(3) Offer multiple approaches to the problem.</b><br>
                                    (4) If using Google Docs during a phone interview, make sure that you document your notes/calculations. Even if you don’t arrive at a solution, the process you used will be documented.<br>
                                    <b>(5) Listen to your interviewer and to their suggestions.</b> If they think you are going in the wrong direction, they will often try to help. You can ask periodically if they have any questions or if you are on the right track.<br>
                                    <b>(6) Don’t bluff.</b> If you don’t know the answer, take a few minutes to think about it. Say that you have not encountered a similar scenario, but you are going to try to work through a process to solve the problem. Think out loud, ask for some direction.<br>
                                    <b>(7) Focus on the process, rather than the answer.</b> If you have no background in the topic; be honest. You can say something like, “I don’t have a background in “topic X”, but I would love to learn about it, and intend to do some research on it after this interview. May I demonstrate my problem-solving skills to you in a different way today?”<br>
                                    <b>(8) Dress Code:</b> For most interviews, business professional attire is expected. This is true for many engineering and technology firms. But there are exceptions, particularly in the startup/tech space, some west coast firms, and for some software focused roles. Please dress according to pre-interview guidelines provided by the company. If in doubt, ask the recruiter.</p>

                                <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Interview Questions askedin HR Interviews is as Following : </b><br><br>
                                  <b>1. Tell me about yourself.</b><br>
                                  One of the more traditional questions in this list, "Tell me about yourself" is nonetheless a helpful question for HR professionals to get a sense for how this conversation will go, and in which direction they should steer future questions.<br></p>                                  
                              </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="row">
                              <div class="col-md-12">
                                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Ultimately, you'll want to be prepared to describe past roles, how those roles demonstrate your strengths, and what you want in a company and role moving forward. Additionally, make sure to include why you believe this role is a good match for your talents.<br><br>
                                  <b>2. Why are you interested in this position?</b><br>
                                  This question is a critical indicator as to whether you're interested in this company and role in particular, or whether you're simply applying to any role in the field. For instance, it's not a good sign if you say, "Well, I'm interested in social media, so this role seemed like a good fit." Instead, you want to mention specific qualifications of the role itself, and demonstrate how those qualifications align with your personal strengths. Additionally, it's important you mention how you can help drive results for the team.<br><br>
                                  <b>3. Why are you leaving your current job?</b><br>
                                  This is an opportunity to outline positive benefits you hope to gain by transitioning into a new role. However, one of the biggest mistakes you can make when answering this question is focusing on negative aspects of your current employer, rather than discussing positive aspects of the new company.<br><br>
                                  
                                  An HR professional will mark it as a red flag if you talk poorly about your current employer or company. It illustrates someone who isn't very professional, has a negative attitude, and could bring toxic energy into their new work environment.<br><br>
                                  <b>4. Can you describe a work or school instance in which you messed up?</b><br>
                                  This is an intentionally tricky question. It's meant to glean insight into whether you can learn from past mistakes. If you can't think of any past errors, it could be an indicator you aren't capable of accepting responsibility for your own mistakes. However, creating a long list of past mishaps could make you look unqualified for the role.<br><br>
                                  
                                  You'll want to answer this question succinctly, and point out an error that doesn't represent a lack of character. Consider one, well-intentioned error you've had in the past, mention it, and then talk about how you grew from that experience.<br><br>
                                  <b>5. Tell me about a time when you experienced conflict with a co-worker and how you dealt with it.</b><br>
                                  The HR professional isn't interested in hearing about that time your co-worker said something snide about you in the kitchen, or when your manager overheard you gossiping about a client to a friend.<br><br>
                                  
                                  Instead, this question is asked to gain insight into how you handle professional conflict. At the office, conflict is bound to arise, particularly when you're working closely with many different people. It's critical you know how to handle conflict without pointing fingers. Your answer should primarily focus on the solution, and should show a level of empathy towards your colleagues, rather than focusing on the problem.<br><br>
                                  <b>6. What do you know about our company?</b><br>
                                  This is a fantastic opportunity to impress the interviewer. Ultimately, this question aims to gauge your level of interest in the company. The more you've researched prior accomplishments, company values, and basic information regarding the product or service, the more you can demonstrate a genuine desire to work there.<br><br>
                                  <b>7. How would you improve our current product or service?</b><br>
                                  An HR professional wants to know whether you're innovative, whether you’re a quick-thinker, and whether you'll bring new ideas to the role. There isn't necessarily a wrong answer, here — you just need to show some creativity, and planning in advance will help. Consider potential problems they might be experiencing with their product or service, and how your unique skillset can fill that void.<br><br>
                                  <b>8. How would your current manager describe you?</b><br>
                                  It can be awkward to brag about yourself, so while this question may seem weird, it's really the HR professional's tactic for hearing how your current boss views you in a work environment. To feel less uncomfortable answering this question, thoughtfully consider your last performance review, and use direct quotes from your boss in your answer.<br><br>
                                  <b>9. Where do you see yourself in five years?</b><br>
                                  This question allows the HR professional to understand your career aspirations — and gauge whether this company is the right place for you to grow. In many ways, this question works as a temperature check to ensure that this is a field you’d like to stay in for the foreseeable future.<br><br>
                                  <b>10. What questions do you have for me?</b><br>
                                  When an HR professional asks you this question, you might be eager to end the call and say, "Nope, no questions." This would be a mistake. Having thoughtful, smart, strategic questions demonstrates your interest in the role, as well as your potential value as a future employee. They want to hire candidates who will ask questions and move the company forward, and this can't happen if you accept everything as-is.<br>
                                  
                                  At this stage, you should consider what your genuine concerns are regarding the role. You might ask the interviewer, "What are the company’s values? What characteristics do you look for in candidates in order to represent those values?" Or, perhaps you'll say, "What do you enjoy most about working at Company A?"<br>
                                  
                                  Ultimately, an interview isn't just about allowing an HR professional to form an opinion of you — it's also a chance for you to get a strong sense for whether you even want to work for the company. So use this last question to your advantage.<br><br></p>

                                          <p style="font-size: 20px;">Technical interviews are common for employers recruiting for engineering, science, or software roles. Essentially it is an interview to assess your technical ability for the role, and the depth and breadth of your knowledge in your chosen field.<br>
          
                                          Technical interviews are also designed to assess your problem-solving skills, your communication skills, and your ability to think under pressure.

                                            <h3>What To Do During The Interview</h3><br><br>
                                            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>(1) Think out loud and verbalize your thought process.</b> Remember that you are being evaluated on this!<br>
                                              <b>(2) Ask clarifying questions.</b> Make sure that you understand the problem and have all of the information that you need. Some problems may be vague or ill-defined to assess your confidence in asking questions and gathering data.<br>
                                              <b>(3) Offer multiple approaches to the problem.</b><br>
                                              (4) If using Google Docs during a phone interview, make sure that you document your notes/calculations. Even if you don’t arrive at a solution, the process you used will be documented.<br>
                                              <b>(5) Listen to your interviewer and to their suggestions.</b> If they think you are going in the wrong direction, they will often try to help. You can ask periodically if they have any questions or if you are on the right track.<br>
                                              <b>(6) Don’t bluff.</b> If you don’t know the answer, take a few minutes to think about it. Say that you have not encountered a similar scenario, but you are going to try to work through a process to solve the problem. Think out loud, ask for some direction.<br>
                                              <b>(7) Focus on the process, rather than the answer.</b> If you have no background in the topic; be honest. You can say something like, “I don’t have a background in “topic X”, but I would love to learn about it, and intend to do some research on it after this interview. May I demonstrate my problem-solving skills to you in a different way today?”<br>
                                              <b>(8) Dress Code:</b> For most interviews, business professional attire is expected. This is true for many engineering and technology firms. But there are exceptions, particularly in the startup/tech space, some west coast firms, and for some software focused roles. Please dress according to pre-interview guidelines provided by the company. If in doubt, ask the recruiter.<br><br></p>

                                          <hr style=" border-color: black; height: 5px;">
                                          <p style="font-size: 20px;">Group discussion is when a group of people comes together to discuss a certain topic. Many Recruiters use group discussion (GD) to test a candidate’s communication skills, leadership skills, test topic knowledge, etc. There are also two other types of GD that test the lateral thinking of a candidate. It is a short case study & Group exercise. Often the group discussion rounds are considered tough, but it is not tough if you follow certain steps.<br><br>

                                            The general discussion (GD) is a session in which the candidate’s abilities are evaluated, including leadership, communication, social and behavioural skills, courtesy, teamwork, listening skills, general awareness, self-assurance, and problem-solving abilities.</p>

                                        <div class="col-md-12">
                                          <p style="font-size: 20px;">Usually, the Group Discussion comes after the entrance exam for a professional degree. Depending on the firms or organisations, the group discussion may be the first or the last step in the hiring process.<br><br>

                                            The location of the group conversation does not have to be at the table. Any seating arrangement is OK as long as everyone can see one another’s faces. It is not only a typical talk; it is also a discussion based on facts and knowledge.<br><br>
                                            <b>What is Group Discussion?</b><br>
                                            A group discussion is a conversation among participants about a specific topic. The selection procedure employed by organisations and educational institutions frequently includes a group discussion. The candidates discuss the assigned subject to present information, viewpoints, and conclusions. Employers employ this method to examine applicants’ soft talents and screen them.<br><br>

                                            <b>Factual group discussions:</b> These discussions focus on the real world and test a candidate’s ability to digest information and analyse socioeconomic or everyday concerns.<br><br>

                                            <b>Opinion-Based Group Discussion:</b> Test how well candidates can articulate their beliefs and viewpoints. These group talks tend to focus more on views than facts.<br><br>
                                            
                                            <b>Group conversations based on case studies:</b> These discussions mimic real-world circumstances.

                                            <b>Abstract Group Discussion:</b> These are abstract group discussions. In these, the interviewers check to see if a candidate can approach the subject at hand with originality and lateral thinking.<br><br></p>
